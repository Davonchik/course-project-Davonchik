# P11 - DAST (OWASP ZAP Baseline) Reports

This directory contains DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) reports generated by OWASP ZAP baseline scan.

## Reports

- `zap_baseline.html` - Human-readable HTML report
- `zap_baseline.json` - Machine-readable JSON report

## Target

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/`
- **Service**: Reading List API (FastAPI)
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health`

## Workflow

Reports are generated automatically by the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci-p11-dast.yml`:

1. Application is started using docker-compose (PostgreSQL + FastAPI)
2. OWASP ZAP baseline scan is executed against the running service
3. Reports are saved to this directory

## Usage

To view the HTML report locally:

```bash
# Open in browser
open EVIDENCE/P11/zap_baseline.html

# Or serve via Python
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080/EVIDENCE/P11/zap_baseline.html
```

## Interpreting Results

- **High**: Critical security issues that should be addressed immediately
- **Medium**: Security concerns that should be reviewed and fixed
- **Low**: Minor security observations
- **Informational**: General security information and best practices

## Notes

- Reports are generated on each push to relevant paths or via manual workflow dispatch
- The workflow uses `owasp/zap2docker-stable` Docker image
- Scan results do not fail the CI pipeline (exit code is ignored with `|| true`)
- Reports are also uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts
